                The new network will be used by users who want to host a web application or file server.
                The project supports communication in hybrid mode, that is, between the company and customers
                (retail) and within the company. Supported business functions involve hosting web and file servers.
                Within the network there are all the components and infrastructure for providing services, as well
                as the professionals of the companies that wish to maintain them. Outside the network are all 
                those who are not customers, as well as those who do not work for the service provider.
